## Introduction

This application provides a graphical representation of the A* path-finding algorithm. Users can create a grid, place a start and end point, add barriers, and visualize how the algorithm finds the shortest path.

## Features

* Visualizes popular pathfinding algorithms such as Dijkstra's and A*.
* Step-by-step animation of the search process, allowing you to see how the algorithms work.
* Option to place obstacles on the grid to create custom maps.
* Selectable starting and ending points on the grid.

## Requirements
* Python 3.10 and above: You can download the latest version of Python from the official website (https://www.python.org/downloads/).
* Pygame: You can install Pygame by running 'pip install pygame' in your terminal.

## Usage
- Download the project repository to your local machine. 
- Navigate to the project directory.
- Run `python3 main.py` if on Linux or Mac
- Run `python main.py` if on Windows

## Command Line Arguments
1. `--cell-size`
Usage: `python main.py`
